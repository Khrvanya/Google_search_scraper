EOS fell by 0.66% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.10% rally from Monday, EOS ended the day at $2.5742.
It was a bullish start to the day, with EOS rising to an early morning intraday high $2.6038 before hitting reverse.
Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $2.6328, EOS slid to a mid-morning intraday low $2.5581.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $2.5316, EOS recovered to $2.59 levels by the late afternoon.
Failing to break back through to $2.60 levels, however, left EOS struggling late in the day. EOS fell back to sub-$2.57 levels before wrapping up the day at $2.57 levels.
At the time of writing, EOS was up by 0.02% to $2.5746. A mixed start to the day saw EOS rise from an early morning low $2.5746 to a high $2.5778 before easing back.
EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to move through the $2.5790 pivot level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $2.5993.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break back through to $2.59 levels.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesday’s high $2.6038 would likely limit any upside.
Failure to move through the $2.5790 pivot could see EOS fall further back.
A fall through to sub-$2.57 levels would bring the first major support level at $2.5536 into play.
Barring an extended sell-off, EOS should avoid sub-$2.50. The second major support level at $2.5330 should limit any downside on the day.
Ethereum fell by 0.05% on Tuesday. Partially reversing Monday’s 6.82% rally, Ethereum ended the day at $243.12.
A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning intraday low $240.73 before finding support.
Steering clear of the first major support level at $231.3, Ethereum rose to a late intraday high $244.80 before easing back.
Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $251.05, Ethereum fell back to sub-$243 and into the red. In spite of a final hour recovery to $243 levels, Ethereum failed to close out the day in the green.

Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
Ethereum would need to avoid a fall through the $242.90 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $245.04.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from Tuesday’s high $244.80.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $245.04 and Tuesday’s high should cap any upside.
In the event of another breakout, expect a breakthrough the second major resistance level at $246.95 to bring $250 into play.
Failure to avoid a fall through the $242.90 pivot could see Ethereum spend the day in the red.
A fall through to sub-$242 levels would bring the first major support level at $240.97 into play.
In the event of an extended sell-off, however, expect the second major support level at $238.81 to come into play.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break back through to $0.19 levels.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Tuesdays’ high $0.19067 would likely cap any upside.

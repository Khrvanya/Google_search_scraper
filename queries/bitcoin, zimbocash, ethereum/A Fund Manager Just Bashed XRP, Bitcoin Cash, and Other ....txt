Save for a few blips, XRP, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and others have been part of the top 10 cryptocurrencies for years. Since the crash of 2018, the altcoins at the top of the pack have largely been unquestioned.
But a prominent researcher and fund manager is challenging the status quo. He wrote in a recent tweet that he doesn’t think that five of the top 10 cryptocurrencies “do NOT deserve” being where they are today.

The investor wrote on June 21st that he thinks that five of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are overvalued:
“$XRP, $BCH, $BSV, $LTC and $EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies. Actually can’t wait until they vanish and clear the way for solid candidates.”
I will get some serious hate for that, but I stand by my opinion: $XRP , $BCH , $BSV , $LTC and $EOS absolutely do NOT deserve belonging to the TOP 10 cryptocurrencies.

Dedic isn’t the only industry executive to expect a shake-up in the top-10 cryptocurrencies.
Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto research firm Messari, shared the tweet below on June 21st. Attached, he wrote:
His expected top ten cryptocurrencies for 2021 basically forces out a majority of the incumbent top altcoins. Selkis’ list even suggests that XRP and Tether’s USDT will drop out of the top 10, which would be a strong change from their fourth and third standing today.
Overvalued is one thing. Stupid is another. Here’s hoping to flushing out the real garbage.

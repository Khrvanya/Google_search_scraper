Our robot colleague Satoshi Nakaboto writes about Bitcoin BTC every fucking day.
Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Aristotle used to say: Fight the power!
We closed the day, June 23 2020, at a price of $9,629. That’s a minor 0.14 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$14.42. It was the lowest closing price in one day.
Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $177,310,052,079. It now commands 65 percent of the total crypto market.
Yesterday’s volume of $17,006,433,272 was the lowest in one day, 26 percent below last year’s average, and 77 percent below last year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 298 tons of gold.
A total of 355,098 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 11 percent above last year’s average and 21 percent below last year’s high.
Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.63. That’s $3.28 below last year’s high of $3.91.
As of now, there are 13,494 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.
Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.1 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.4 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.
With a market capitalization of $178 billion, Comcast has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.
On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.
He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 97.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $397,567 by now, according to dickline.info.
Bitcoin used an estimated 165 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 60 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Algeria’s energy consumption or 5.6 million US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.27% of the whole world’s electricity use.
Yesterday 34,373 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 75.1 percent above last year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day last year about Bitcoin was 82,838.
This was one of yesterday’s most engaged tweets about Bitcoin:

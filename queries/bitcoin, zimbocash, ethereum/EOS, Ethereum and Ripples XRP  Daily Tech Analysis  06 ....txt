It’s a bearish start to the day. Failure to move through the pivot levels will bring support levels into play…
EOS rallied by 3.43% on Friday. Following on from a 0.88% gain on Thursday, EOS ended the day at $2.8153.
A choppy start to the day saw EOS rise to a late morning high $2.7658 before hitting reverse.
EOS broke through the first major resistance level at $2.7582 before falling to a late morning intraday low $2.7082.
Steering well clear of the major support levels, EOS rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $2.8650.
EOS broke through the first major resistance level and second major resistance level at $2.7942.
In spite of a late pullback, EOS managed to avoid a return to sub-$2.80 levels late in the day.

EOS left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.
EOS would need to avoid sub-$2.7960 levels to take a run at the first major resistance level at $2.8841 into play.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for EOS to break out from Friday’s high $2.8650.
Barring another extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $2.8841 would likely cap any upside.
Failure to avoid sub-$2.7960 levels could see EOS give up Friday’s gains.
A fall through the $2.7960 pivot would bring the first major support level at $2.7273 into play.
Barring a crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$2.70 support levels. The second major support level sits at $2.6394.
Ethereum fell by 1.29% on Friday. Following on from a 0.58% decline on Thursday, Ethereum ended the day at $240.04.

Ethereum would need to move through to $242 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $245.74.
Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from the morning high $240.04.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Thursday’s high should cap any upside.
Failure to move through to $242 levels could see Ethereum see a 3rd consecutive day in the red.
A fall back through the morning low $237.67 would bring the first major support level at $236.49 into play.
Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Ethereum should continue to steer clear sub-$230 levels on the day.
The second major support level at $232.95 should limit any downside on the day.

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ripple’s XRP to break out from the morning high $0.20256.
Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Friday’s high $0.20582 would likely cap any upside on the day.
Failure to move through to $0.2030 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red.
A fall back through the morning low $0.20104 would bring the first major support level at $0.2006 into play.
Barring another crypto sell-off, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.1986.

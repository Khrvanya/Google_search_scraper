MyCrypto, a non-custodial Ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 token wallet developed by the co-founder of MyEtherWallet, has an exclusive feature that will enable  Ethereum (ETH) users to schedule their Ethereum (ETH) transactions.
MyCrypto is an open source digital currency wallet quite similar to the structure of MyEtherWallet. Notably, users could experience a better interface for their existing wallets, as MyCrypto can connect hardware wallets such as Trezor and other non-custodial wallets like MetaMask. So, the feature of scheduling Ethereum transactions can be availed by any ETH wallet user, barring their wallets are connected with MyCrypto.
The feature uses smart contracts of Chrono Logic and temporal Ethereum-driven innovation to schedule ETH transactions. MyCrypto becomes the first digital currency wallet platform to implement this smart feature.
The users could register for transactions ahead of time on the Mainnet of Ethereum. The scheduling opens a new avenue for cryptocurrency payments which couldn’t be availed before. For instance, ETH users can send fund to an Initial Coin Offering in advance to avoid being left out of the token sale or send payments to subscriptions before time or schedule transactions to suppliers.
Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, shared his excitement about the new feature the new feature, during an interview with the team of Chrono Logic.  He adds that the feature is extremely valuable and could attract more users towards the digital tokes.

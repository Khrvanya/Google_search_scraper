There are far more bitcoin options set to expire this week than usual--something that could trigger ... [+] a fresh wave of market volatility.
Meanwhile, despite a surge in bitcoin options interest, most bitcoin buyers are treating it as digital gold , preferring to hold bitcoin for the long term term.
"The data shows that the majority of bitcoin is held by those who treat it as digital gold: an asset to be held for the long term," Chainalysis researchers wrote last week.
"With more people looking to trade bitcoin, which is only becoming more scarce following the recent halving, bitcoin moving from the investment bucket into the trading bucket could become a crucial source of liquidity. However, one would expect this will only happen if bitcoinâ€™s price rises to a level at which long-term investors are willing to sell."

I am a journalist with significant experience covering technology, finance, economics, and business around the world. As the founding editor of Verdict.co.uk I reported on how technology is changing business, political trends, and the latest culture and lifestyle. I have covered the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency since 2012 and have charted its emergence as a niche technology into the greatest threat to the established financial system the world has ever seen and the most important new technology since the internet itself. I have worked and written for CityAM, the Financial Times, and the New Statesman, amongst others. Follow me on Twitter @billybambrough or email me on billyATbillybambrough.com.
Disclosure: I occasionally hold some small amount of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

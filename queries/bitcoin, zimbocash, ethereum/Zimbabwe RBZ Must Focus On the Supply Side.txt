The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) should work on the supply side of the economy to enable the country to inject significant amounts of foreign currency into productive sectors, analysts have said.
The RBZ this week directed that a priority list for foreign currency payments be adhered to with immediate effect to ensure that foreign currency resources are channelled to the productive sectors of the economy in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.
"Reference made to various economic measures implemented by the bank to sustain company operations and ensure quick resuscitation of economic activity during and post the Covid-19 pandemic," RBZ exchange control director Farai Masendu said in the new RBZ Exchange Control Circular No.5 of 2020 to Authorised Dealers and Bureaux de Change.
"Accordingly, and consistent with Exchange Control Circular No. 3 of 2020, authorised dealers and bureaux de Change are advised that the attached priority list for foreign currency payments shall apply with immediate effect to ensure that foreign currency resources are substantially channelled to the productive sectors of the economy in light of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"Compliance with this requirement is critical to ensure that the economy responds positively to the enhancing of production in the country," Masendu said.
However, economist and Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce chief executive Christopher Mugaga believes the central bank should focus its energies on enhancing the supply side framework of the economy.
"Using a prescriptive model to channel forex is a major challenge, especially in the post-Covid-19 era" Mugaga said.
"The circular by the RBZ is much ado about nothing. It is nothing new. It is a reminder of the failed priority list it had. They should spend more time and energy on supply side management rather than the demand model management. You cannot be spending time deciding what to do with other people's money."

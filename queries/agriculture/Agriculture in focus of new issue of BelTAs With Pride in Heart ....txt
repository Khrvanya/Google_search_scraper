MINSK, 23 June (BelTA) – The latest issue of BelTA's multimedia project “With Pride in Heart” focuses on the development of the agricultural sector in Belarus.
The issue under the title “Agriculture: From revival to new markets” is about the main milestones in the development of the Belarusian agricultural sector, about agricultural workers and scientists, processing enterprises, staff training – everything that ensures Belarus' food security.
The history of success of the industry is exemplified by the country's leading agricultural enterprises that are known well beyond Belarus: Agrokombinat Snov, Servolux, Progress Vertelishki, Rassvet named after K.P. Orlovsky, and so on.
BelTA's project “With Pride in Heart” was launched on 16 June. It is dedicated to the achievements of the sovereign Belarus in various fields.
Since gaining independence, Belarus has come a long way, and the results of this development have benefited every Belarusian. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Belarus has managed not only to preserve the country, but also to expand its economic capacity, provide all citizens with the necessary social guarantees, and strengthen the national security. Belarus' voice is heard in respected international organizations, mostly thanks to peace initiatives of the country's authorities.
Every issue of the “With Pride in Heart” project will tell about the country's achievements in many areas, from advanced technologies and national security to healthcare and national culture.
The project relies on the historical information, archival newspapers, photos, videos, and also BelTA's news materials and infographics.
The first long-read was dedicated to the manufacturing industry.

More than 100 teachers from 40 Minnesota counties joined Minnesota Agriculture in the Classroom on Tuesday for the first of a four-part virtual agriculture tour to help educators learn and plan curriculum for the fall, according to a press release.
The tour, which had been done previously through in-person visits to farms and other locations around Minnesota in prior years, is taking place virtually this year over four dates:
• June 23: Farm to Fork, including stops at Sleepy Bison Acres and Sleepy Eye Coffee Co. in Sleepy Eye
• June 30: School Gardens, including a stop at the Grow Our Own Project at St. Paul Public Schools
The tours will take place from 9 to 11 a.m. using a combination of Zoom and a private Facebook group to encourage interactivity. Teachers are also receiving resources and lesson supplies via mail.
Any media interested in participating in the tours should email keri.sidle@state.mn.us for more information.
Minnesota Agriculture in the Classroom is a public/private partnership between the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and Minnesota Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation that provides free curriculum, educational resources, grants, outreach and professional development opportunities to increase ag literacy through K-12 education.

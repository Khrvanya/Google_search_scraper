ALPENA, Mich — Harmful and invasive species, some invisible to the naked eye , can hide in or on firewood.
These new infestations of invasive pests or diseases can pose a serious threat to Michigan’s agriculture, forests and the environment.
According to Spokesperson, Mike Philip, you should never assume that wood appearing to not be infested is safe to move.
Another Spokesperson, Jason Fleming, suggested as camping resumes this year, campers should purchase firewood at state park campgrounds instead of bringing your own.

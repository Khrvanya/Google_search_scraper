Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau today spoke with the European Union’s Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski.
Minister Bibeau and Commissioner Wojciechowski emphasized the strength of the Canada-EU relationship, especially in agricultural trade. They reiterated the need to work collaboratively to ensure a well-functioning integrated supply chain in food and food products between Europe and Canada, which is essential to safeguarding the health and wellbeing of citizens during COVID-19.
Both ministers also emphasized the need for free and open trade, especially in the current COVID-19 crisis, and benefits of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), provisionally applied since September 2017.
In addition, Minister Bibeau emphasized that Canada and the EU need to co-operate to ensure that our farmers and processors benefit from the trade agreement, underscoring the importance of improving EU market access for Canadian agricultural products through the removal of technical barriers to trade.
“Maintaining strong trade with our European friends and allies will be essential for our economic restart. During my discussion with Commissioner Wojciechowski, I built upon the strength of that long-standing relationship and promoted the high-quality of Canadian agri-food products.”
– The Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food
